## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# S&P 500 Index Stock
ticker1 = yf.Ticker("INX")
data1 = ticker1.history(period = "max")
print(data1.to_string())

# Schwab Index Stock
ticker2 = yf.Ticker("SWPPX")
data2 = ticker2.history(period = "max")
print(data2.to_string())
# Microsoft Stock. I wanted to include a consistent large cap stock
ticker3 = yf.Ticker("MSFT")
data3 = ticker3.history(period = "max")
print(data3.to_string())
```

I have not fully decided which stock indexes, ETFs, or Large cap data to work with yet, but above is a start. The code shown retrieves the stock data using the yfinance package, which helps retrieves Yahoo stock data. I plan to implement a cleaner csv format for the stock data later, but the only columns I would be taking are the date, opening price, and closing price. I plan to range the data from the year 2000-2023, and then use the models to predict 2024 prices. 

## Goal

The high-level goal for this project will be to implement a successful ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet model to predict stock prices

## 

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
